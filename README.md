## 🚀 Getting Started

Getting this project up and running on your local machine is a breeze.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abbeyzerotheorem/0-theorem.git
cd 0-theorem
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

We use `npm` to manage our packages. Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

The contact form uses Web3Forms. To get it working, you'll need to provide your own access key.

Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add your key:

```env
# Get your free access key from https://web3forms.com/
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
```

*Note: I've updated the contact form to use this environment variable for you.*

### 4. Run the Development Server

You're all set! Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
